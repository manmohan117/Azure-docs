# Hosting applications on Azure

Azure provides a variety of different ways to host your application depending on your needs.

The services you choose will often come down to two considerations:

- Do you prefer simplicity or control?
- Do you prefer cloud-native (i.e., containers) or Azure-native (tailored tools and integrations)
## Simplicity and control

Azure hosting services are provided with two considerations:- 

- **Simplicity versus control**
    - Simple hosting platforms require less configuration and management but provide less control over the underlying infrastructure.
    - More complex hosting platforms require more configuration and management but provide more control over the underlying infrastructure.
    
- **Cloud-native versus Azure-native**
	-  Cloud-native can be thought of as cloud-portable using open-source workloads such as containers and open-source technologies such as Dapr. The applications you build can be deployed to any cloud provider.
	- Azure-native is specific to Azure with an investment in Azure-specific tools and technologies to manage that infrastructure
## Simplified hosting

**Simplified**¬†hosting solutions are fully managed by Azure. You're responsible for the functionality such as code and environment configuration.
- [Logic Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-overview): Create and run automated workflows with little to no code.
- [Power Automate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate): Use when you need to automate business processes and workflows.
- [Azure Static Web Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps): Deploy generated static web apps such as Blazor and React.
- [Azure Functions Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions): serverless code or container hosting.

## Balanced hosting
**Balanced**¬†hosting solutions balance the need for simplicity with the need for control. You're responsible for the functionality such as code and environment configuration. Azure manages the underlying runtime and infrastructure including updates and patches. You can also bring your own container to the service. Balanced hosting is both Azure-native and Cloud-native.

- [Azure App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service): Full-service web hosting including language runtimes, containers, and automation workloads.
- [Azure Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps): Serverless container hosting.
- [Azure Spring Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/spring-apps): Migrate Spring Boot applications to the Azure cloud.

## Controlled hosting

**Controlled**¬†hosting solutions give you full control over the underlying infrastructure. You're responsible for updates and patches as well as your code, assets, and environment configuration. Controlled hosting is the cloud-native approach.

- [Azure Virtual Machines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines): Full control of VM.
- [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks): Full control of Kubernetes cluster.


## Source-code hosting

### No code or low code

Azure supports no-code solutions are part of its Azure-Cloud approach.

- [Logic Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-overview): Use a visual designer with prebuilt operations to develop a workflow for your enterprise and business-to-business scenarios.
- [Power Automate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate)¬†such as¬†[Power apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps): Use when you need to automate business processes and workflows within the Microsoft 365 organization.

### Code vs container

**Low-code**¬†hosting solutions are designed to allow you to bring your code functionality without having to manage the application infrastructure.

- [Azure Static Web Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps): deploy generated static web apps.
- [Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions): deploy code functions in supported languages without having to manage the application infrastructure.
**Code-first**¬†hosting solutions are designed to host code. You can deploy your code directly to the hosting solution.

- [Azure App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service): full-service web hosting.
- [Azure Spring Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/spring-apps): Spring Boot applications.

**Container-first**¬†hosting solutions are designed to host containers. The service provides container-specific configuration options and features. You're responsible for the compute used inside the container. The services which host containers move from managed control to full responsibility so you only take on the amount of container management you want.

**Kubernetes-centric**¬†orchestration hosting includes:
