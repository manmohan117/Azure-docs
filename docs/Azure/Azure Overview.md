Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform with an ever-expanding set of services to help you build solutions to meet your business goals. Azure services support everything from simple to complex.

Azure provides a wealth of cloud-based services like remote storage, database hosting, and centralized account management. Azure also offers new capabilities like artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) focused services.

Azure is a continually expanding set of cloud services that help you meet current and future business challenges. Azure gives you the freedom to build, manage, and deploy applications on a massive global network using your favorite tools and frameworks.

Azure provides more than 100 services that enable you to do everything from running your existing applications on virtual machines to exploring new software paradigms, such as intelligent bots and mixed reality.

## Cloud Fundamentals

#What  is cloud computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Computing services include common IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking.

### #What  is shared responsibility model

The shared responsibility model is a framework that establishes cloud security responsibilities between cloud service providers (CSPs) and customers. This model dictates that while CSPs are responsible for the security of the underlying infrastructure, customers are responsible for securing their cloud-hosted data and applications.  
  
Generally, CSPs must protect cloud infrastructure, while organizations must secure their applications, endpoints, accounts and identities, and data. Yet the exact requirements depend on the CSP and type of cloud service delivery used. The specific requirements of the Shared Responsibility Model are contained in the service-level agreement (SLA) between the CSP and customer.  
  
### #What  is (SLA).

A service level agreement (SLA) is a legally binding contract between a customer and a service provider. It defines the services to be provided, the performance levels to be expected, and the consequences if the service provider fails to meet those levels. 


#What  does an SLA include?

- Service definition: What services will be provided, and what level of performance is expected 
    
- Performance metrics: How performance will be measured, such as uptime, response time, and resolution time 
    
- Consequences: What will happen if the service provider doesn't meet the performance levels, such as additional support or discounts 
    
- Cancellation conditions: What will happen if the agreement is canceled 
    
- Plan for unmet goals: What will happen if the service provider doesn't meet the goals 
    
#### Why are SLAs important? 

- SLAs help set clear expectations for service quality and performance
    
- SLAs help hold service providers accountable
    
- SLAs help improve the customer experience
    
- SLAs help protect the interests of all parties involved

#### The cloud provider is always responsible for:

- The physical datacenter
    
- The physical network
    
- The physical hosts
    

#### Your service model will determine responsibility for things like:

- Operating systems
    
- Network controls
    
- Applications
    
- Identity and infrastructure
    
### Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)

In this delivery model, the CSP manages the IT infrastructure—including physical networking, storage, servers, and other components—and delivers it to the customer via an Internet connection. Meanwhile, customers maintain their operating systems, databases, applications, identities and accounts, endpoints , network configuration, and data. Of the three service models, IaaS assigns customers the greatest responsibility over security. 

 Examples of IaaS offerings include AWS, Google Compute Engine, and Microsoft Azure. #examples 

 Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)

In this delivery model, the CSP manages the IT infrastructure, as well as a platform and tools for application development, all of which customers can access via Internet connection. In this model, customers often need to secure their data, endpoints, applications, identities and accounts, as well as certain aspects of the application platform. 

##Examples of PaaS offerings include AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, and Azure App Services.

#Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) or serverless

 In this delivery model, the CSP manages every service except for developing and deploying application code. The CSP handles resource allocation and server provisioning to automatically scale resources up or down based on workload demands. In this model, the customer remains responsible for securing their data, endpoints, identities, and accounts.

 Examples of SaaS/serverless offerings include AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Microsoft Azure Functions. #examples


## Cloud Models. #cloud



There are Three Main cloud Models

- Private Cloud
- 
    
- Public Cloud
    
- Hybrid Cloud
### Private Cloud

  
It’s a cloud (delivering IT services over the internet) that’s used by a single entity. Private cloud provides much greater control for the company and its IT department. However, it also comes with greater cost and fewer of the benefits of a public cloud deployment.

### Public cloud

  

A public cloud is built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider. With a public cloud, anyone that wants to purchase cloud services can access and use resources. The general public availability is a key difference between public and private clouds.

  

### Hybrid cloud #cloud 

  

A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment. A hybrid cloud environment can be used to allow a private cloud to surge for increased, temporary demand by deploying public cloud resources. Hybrid cloud can be used to provide an extra layer of security. For example, users can flexibly choose which services to keep in public cloud and which to deploy to their private cloud infrastructure.

### Multi-cloud #cloud 

A fourth, and increasingly likely scenario is a multi-cloud scenario. In a multi-cloud scenario, you use multiple public cloud providers. Maybe you use different features from different cloud providers. Or maybe you started your cloud journey with one provider and are in the process of migrating to a different provider. Regardless, in a multi-cloud environment you deal with two (or more) public cloud providers and manage resources and security in both environments.

  

### Azure Arc #cloud 

Azure Arc is a set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environment. Azure Arc can help manage your cloud environment, whether it's a public cloud solely on Azure, a private cloud in your datacenter, a hybrid configuration, or even a multi-cloud environment running on multiple cloud providers at once.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfGaJKzAeCPI9NnnFlfQtikq41UJ2Jag1NZKmxiJ7ncUyDm9Olh3RQ9dsugG4Juk8xNQIE8A5KiOGFApFGK9LnrhA3u-1hyRWzpVicseokLe0tmnqieVHuWtlv5w_tgSqkVR-Dg4g?key=U3Uz_xqKVJ7WHu9OxZk_Qswf)


### consumption-based model #cloud 

  

When comparing IT infrastructure models, there are two types of expenses to consider. Capital expenditure (CapEx) and operational expenditure (OpEx).

- CapEx is typically a one-time, up-front expenditure to purchase or secure tangible resources.
    
- OpEx is spending money on services or products over time. Renting a convention center, leasing a company vehicle, or signing up for cloud services are all examples of OpEx.
    

Cloud computing falls under OpEx because cloud computing operates on a consumption-based model. With cloud computing, you don’t pay for the physical infrastructure, the electricity, the security, or anything else associated with maintaining a datacenter. Instead, you pay for the IT resources you use. If you don’t use any IT resources this month, you don’t pay for any IT resources.

  

### Benefits of Consumption based Model.

This consumption-based model has many benefits, including:

- No upfront costs.
    
- No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest potential.
    
- The ability to pay for more resources when they're needed.
    
- The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.
    
 
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a pay-as-you-go pricing model. You typically pay only for the cloud services you use, which helps you: 

- Plan and manage your operating costs.
    
- Run your infrastructure more efficiently.
    
- Scale as your business needs change.
    

## Scalability and Availability.

When building or deploying a cloud application, two of the biggest considerations are uptime (or availability) and the ability to handle demand (or scale).



## High availability

When you’re deploying an application, a service, or any IT resources, it’s important the resources are available when needed. High availability focuses on ensuring maximum availability, regardless of disruptions or events that may occur.

Scalability refers to the ability to adjust resources to meet demand. If you suddenly experience peak traffic and your systems are overwhelmed, the ability to scale means you can add more resources to better handle the increased demand.  
  
## Scalability

Another major benefit of cloud computing is the scalability of cloud resources. Scalability refers to the ability to adjust resources to meet demand. If you suddenly experience peak traffic and your systems are overwhelmed, the ability to scale means you can add more resources to better handle the increased demand.

### Vertical scaling

With vertical scaling, if you were developing an app and you needed more processing power, you could vertically scale up to add more CPUs or RAM to the virtual machine. Conversely, if you realized you had over-specified the needs, you could vertically scale down by lowering the CPU or RAM specifications.

### Horizontal scaling

With horizontal scaling, if you suddenly experienced a steep jump in demand, your deployed resources could be scaled out (either automatically or manually). For example, you could add additional virtual machines or containers, scaling out. In the same manner, if there was a significant drop in demand, deployed resources could be scaled in (either automatically or manually), scaling in.

## Reliability

Reliability is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function. It's also one of the pillars of the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework.

  
Predictability

Predictability in the cloud lets you move forward with confidence. Predictability can be focused on performance predictability or cost predictability. Both performance and cost predictability are heavily influenced by the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework. Deploy a solution built around this framework and you have a solution whose cost and performance are predictable.

### Performance

Performance predictability focuses on predicting the resources needed to deliver a positive experience for your customers. Autoscaling, load balancing, and high availability are just some of the cloud concepts that support performance predictability. If you suddenly need more resources, autoscaling can deploy additional resources to meet the demand, and then scale back when the demand drops. Or if the traffic is heavily focused on one area, load balancing will help redirect some of the overload to less stressed areas.

### Cost

Cost predictability is focused on predicting or forecasting the cost of the cloud spend. With the cloud, you can track your resource use in real time, monitor resources to ensure that you’re using them in the most efficient way, and apply data analytics to find patterns and trends that help better plan resource deployments. By operating in the cloud and using cloud analytics and information, you can predict future costs and adjust your resources as needed.


## Cloud Managebility #cloud 

A major benefit of cloud computing is the manageability options. There are two types of manageability for cloud computing that you’ll learn about in this series, and both are excellent benefits.

### Management of the cloud #cloud 

Management of the cloud speaks to managing your cloud resources. In the cloud, you can:

- Automatically scale resource deployment based on need.
    
- Deploy resources based on a preconfigured template, removing the need for manual configuration.
    
- Monitor the health of resources and automatically replace failing resources.
    
- Receive automatic alerts based on configured metrics, so you’re aware of performance in real time.
    

### Management in the cloud #cloud 

Management in the cloud speaks to how you’re able to manage your cloud environment and resources. You can manage these:

- Through a web portal.
    
- Using a command line interface.
    
- Using APIs.
    
- Using PowerShell.
    

## Azure physical infrastructure #infra


The core architectural components of Azure may be broken down into two main groupings: the physical infrastructure, and the management infrastructure.

### Physical infrastructure #infra 

The physical infrastructure for Azure starts with datacenters. Conceptually, the datacenters are the same as large corporate datacenters. They’re facilities with resources arranged in racks, with dedicated power, cooling, and networking infrastructure.

Azure has datacenters around the world. However, these individual datacenters aren’t directly accessible. Datacenters are grouped into Azure Regions or Azure Availability Zones that are designed to help you achieve resiliency and reliability for your business-critical workloads.

  
### Regions #infra 
A region is a geographical area on the planet that contains at least one, but potentially multiple datacenters that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network. 

  
![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcy-_JU12-AFC7dmSuAWUocCcmZn0Sf1PofTz_KDKjmk6bIsMej9wzboU_0wuW3Dszcbb66dpt_bJbNPmYDjZTTUP_2hrl8A5UzyxEyOeaEM4eM-fgzbDdxwqmVa6Ia-vt9F0Jx?key=U3Uz_xqKVJ7WHu9OxZk_Qswf)  

Important!!!

To ensure resiliency, a minimum of three separate availability zones are present in all availability zone-enabled regions. However, not all Azure Regions currently support availability zones.

### Availability Zones #infra

Availability zones are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region. Each availability zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. An availability zone is set up to be an isolation boundary. If one zone goes down, the other continues working. Availability zones are connected through high-speed, private fiber-optic networks.



#important
To ensure resiliency, a minimum of three separate availability zones are present in all availability zone-enabled regions. However, not all Azure Regions currently support availability zones.

  
  

#Note
Some services or virtual machine (VM) features are only available in certain regions, such as specific VM sizes or storage types. There are also some global Azure services that don't require you to select a particular region, such as Microsoft Entra ID, Azure Traffic Manager, and Azure DNS.


### Use availability zones in your apps

You want to ensure your services and data are redundant so you can protect your information in case of failure. When you host your infrastructure, setting up your own redundancy requires that you create duplicate hardware environments. Azure can help make your app highly available through availability zones.

You can use availability zones to run mission-critical applications and build high-availability into your application architecture by co-locating your compute, storage, networking, and data resources within an availability zone and replicating in other availability zones. Keep in mind that there could be a cost to duplicating your services and transferring data between availability zones.

Availability zones are primarily for VMs, managed disks, load balancers, and SQL databases. Azure services that support availability zones fall into three categories:

- Zonal services: You pin the resource to a specific zone (for example, VMs, managed disks, IP addresses).
    
- Zone-redundant services: The platform replicates automatically across zones (for example, zone-redundant storage, SQL Database).
    
- Non-regional services: Services are always available from Azure geographies and are resilient to zone-wide outages as well as region-wide outages.
    

Even with the additional resiliency that availability zones provide, it’s possible that an event could be so large that it impacts multiple availability zones in a single region. To provide even further resilience, Azure has Region Pairs.

### Region pairs #infra

Most Azure regions are paired with another region within the same geography (such as US, Europe, or Asia) at least 300 miles away. This approach allows for the replication of resources across a geography that helps reduce the likelihood of interruptions because of events such as natural disasters, civil unrest, power outages, or physical network outages that affect an entire region. For example, if a region in a pair was affected by a natural disaster, services would automatically fail over to the other region in its region pair.

  

#Important

Not all Azure services automatically replicate data or automatically fall back from a failed region to cross-replicate to another enabled region. In these scenarios, recovery and replication must be configured by the customer.

## Geography #infra 

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdeHCzl2PSQAjY_Amr_u8JhpoetwjQLcKuP3l-zul427vcy7DULRcmNziMXoWq939Ah6n7zAG5VpIrfGsMlxetJgPkTvm9-9GefjrAXaXx8Fsp369YiDhWzoXI_MNWtcAYR1STDgw?key=U3Uz_xqKVJ7WHu9OxZk_Qswf)  
  
### Additional advantages of region pairs: #infra 

- If an extensive Azure outage occurs, one region out of every pair is prioritized to make sure at least one is restored as quickly as possible for applications hosted in that region pair.
    
- Planned Azure updates are rolled out to paired regions one region at a time to minimize downtime and risk of application outage.
    
- Data continues to reside within the same geography as its pair (except for Brazil South) for tax- and law-enforcement jurisdiction purposes.
    



#Important

Most regions are paired in two directions, meaning they are the backup for the region that provides a backup for them (West US and East US back each other up). However, some regions, such as West India and Brazil South, are paired in only one direction. In a one-direction pairing, the Primary region does not provide backup for its secondary region. So, even though West India’s secondary region is South India, South India does not rely on West India. West India's secondary region is South India, but South India's secondary region is Central India. Brazil South is unique because it's paired with a region outside of its geography. Brazil South's secondary region is South Central US. The secondary region of South Central US isn't Brazil South.

  
  

### Sovereign Regions #infra 

In addition to regular regions, Azure also has sovereign regions. Sovereign regions are instances of Azure that are isolated from the main instance of Azure. You may need to use a sovereign region for compliance or legal purposes.

Azure sovereign regions include:

- US DoD Central, US Gov Virginia, US Gov Iowa and more: These regions are physical and logical network-isolated instances of Azure for U.S. government agencies and partners. These datacenters are operated by screened U.S. personnel and include additional compliance certifications.
    
- China East, China North, and more: These regions are available through a unique partnership between Microsoft and 21Vianet, whereby Microsoft doesn't directly maintain the datacenters.
    


# Azure management infrastructure #infra 

The management infrastructure includes Azure resources and resource groups, subscriptions, and accounts.

## Azure resources and resource groups

A resource is the basic building block of Azure. Anything you create, provision, deploy, etc. is a resource. Virtual Machines (VMs), virtual networks, databases, cognitive services, etc. are all considered resources within Azure.

![[Pasted image 20250212103233.png]]

Resource groups are simply groupings of resources. When you create a resource, you’re required to place it into a resource group. While a resource group can contain many resources, a single resource can only be in one resource group at a time. Some resources may be moved between resource groups, but when you move a resource to a new group, it will no longer be associated with the former group. Additionally, resource groups can't be nested, meaning you can’t put resource group B inside of resource group A.

Resource groups provide a convenient way to group resources together. When you apply an action to a resource group, that action will apply to all the resources within the resource group. If you delete a resource group, all the resources will be deleted. If you grant or deny access to a resource group, you’ve granted or denied access to all the resources within the resource group.


## Azure subscriptions
In Azure, subscriptions are a unit of management, billing, and scale. Similar to how resource groups are a way to logically organize resources, subscriptions allow you to logically organize your resource groups and facilitate billing.

![[Pasted image 20250212104003.png]]


A subscription provides you with authenticated and authorized access to Azure products and services. It also allows you to provision resources. An Azure subscription links to an Azure account, which is an identity in Microsoft Entra ID or in a directory that Microsoft Entra ID trusts.

An account can have multiple subscriptions, but it’s only required to have one. In a multi-subscription account, you can use the subscriptions to configure different billing models and apply different access-management policies. You can use Azure subscriptions to define boundaries around Azure products, services, and resources. There are two types of subscription boundaries that you can use:

- **Billing boundary**: This subscription type determines how an Azure account is billed for using Azure. You can create multiple subscriptions for different types of billing requirements. Azure generates separate billing reports and invoices for each subscription so that you can organize and manage costs.

- **Access control boundary**: Azure applies access-management policies at the subscription level, and you can create separate subscriptions to reflect different organizational structures. An example is that within a business, you have different departments to which you apply distinct Azure subscription policies. This billing model allows you to manage and control access to the resources that users provision with specific subscriptions.

## Azure management groups

 If you’re just starting in Azure that might seem like enough hierarchy to keep things organized. But imagine if you’re dealing with multiple applications, multiple development teams, in multiple geographies.

If you have many subscriptions, you might need a way to efficiently manage access, policies, and compliance for those subscriptions. Azure management groups provide a level of scope above subscriptions. You organize subscriptions into containers called management groups and apply governance conditions to the management groups. All subscriptions within a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group, the same way that resource groups inherit settings from subscriptions and resources inherit from resource groups. Management groups give you enterprise-grade management at a large scale, no matter what type of subscriptions you might have. Management groups can be nested.

## Management group, subscriptions, and resource group hierarchy

![[Pasted image 20250212105018.png]]
Important facts about management groups: #Important 

- 10,000 management groups can be supported in a single directory.
- A management group tree can support up to six levels of depth. This limit doesn't include the root level or the subscription level.
- Each management group and subscription can support only one parent.


# Azure compute and networking services #compute


## Azure virtual machines

A **Virtual Machine** (VM) is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps. One or more virtual “guest” machines run on a physical “host” machine. Each virtual machine runs its own operating system and functions separately from the other VMs, even when they are all running on the same host.

View more about virtual machine [[Azure Virtual Machines]].

## Azure virtual desktop

Azure Virtual Desktop is a desktop and application virtualization service that runs on the cloud. It enables you to use a cloud-hosted version of Windows from any location. Azure Virtual Desktop works across devices and operating systems, and works with apps that you can use to access remote desktops or most modern browsers.

## Azure containers
Containers are a virtualization environment. Much like running multiple virtual machines on a single physical host, you can run multiple containers on a single physical or virtual host. Unlike virtual machines, you don't manage the operating system for a container. Virtual machines appear to be an instance of an operating system that you can connect to and manage. Containers are lightweight and designed to be created, scaled out, and stopped dynamically. It's possible to create and deploy virtual machines as application demand increases, but containers are a lighter weight, more agile method. Containers are designed to allow you to respond to changes on demand. With containers, you can quickly restart if there's a crash or hardware interruption. One of the most popular container engines is Docker, and Azure supports Docker.

### Azure Container Instances

Azure Container Instances offer the fastest and simplest way to run a container in Azure; without having to manage any virtual machines or adopt any additional services. Azure Container Instances are a platform as a service (PaaS) offering. Azure Container Instances allow you to upload your containers and then the service runs the containers for you.

### Azure Container Apps

Azure Container Apps are similar in many ways to a container instance. They allow you to get up and running right away, they remove the container management piece, and they're a PaaS offering. Container Apps have extra benefits such as the ability to incorporate load balancing and scaling. These other functions allow you to be more elastic in your design.

### Azure Kubernetes Service

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a container orchestration service. An orchestration service manages the lifecycle of containers. When you're deploying a fleet of containers, AKS can make fleet management simpler and more efficient.

## Azure functions

Azure Functions is an event-driven, serverless compute option that doesn’t require maintaining virtual machines or containers. If you build an app using VMs or containers, those resources have to be “running” in order for your app to function. With Azure Functions, an event wakes the function, alleviating the need to keep resources provisioned when there are no events.

## Application hosting options
