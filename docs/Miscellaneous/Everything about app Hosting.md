## What is app hosting

Mobile apps generally consist of two parts: The client-side (frontend) and the server-side (backend). The client-side is the user interface that runs on the user’s device, while the server-side manages the data, logic, and communication between the app and various services.

App hosting refers to the process of providing the necessary infrastructure and services to deploy, run, and manage an application’s server-side components. These components typically handle tasks such as data storage, user authentication, server-side processing, and more.

## Hosting Options Available

##### 1. Traditional Hosting

With “traditional” hosting or [dedicated server hosting](https://www.dreamhost.com/hosting/dedicated/), your application’s server-side components are hosted on physical servers, often managed by a hosting provider. The provider is responsible for maintaining the hardware, providing network connectivity, and ensuring uptime.
###### Advantages of Traditional Hosting

Consider traditional hosting like buying a gigantic pickup truck. It’s a high-performance machine. You’ll get full control over the server setup and configuration. You’ll generally get more CPU power and memory.
It’s certainly the best option if you need high scalability, high performance, and total control over the system and security.

But, if you’re looking for a daily driver, it may be a bit overkill.

###### Disadvantages of Traditional Hosting

If we could all spring for our own dedicated server, we’d probably do it.

The obvious limitation is pricing. Although prices vary by provider, renting (or buying) a dedicated server is pretty much always the most expensive option.



##### 2. Virtual Private Servers (VPS)

[VPS hosting](https://www.dreamhost.com/hosting/vps/) involves dividing a physical server into multiple virtual servers, each with its own operating system and resources.

This allows multiple applications to be hosted on a single physical server while maintaining isolation between them. VPS hosting provides more control and customization options than traditional hosting but still requires server management and maintenance.

###### Advantages of VPS

VPS is often considered a middle ground; You get a high level of customization and a decent level of performance.

This also makes it much more affordable than buying or renting an entire server, but for good reason.

###### Disadvantages of VPS

VPS hosting will always be limited by your share of the resources on the server. The way VPS hosting works is that the CPU power and memory is split across multiple sites or web applications.

You’re generally guaranteed a certain amount of resources, but you could experience real-time performance issues if, let’s say, your site goes viral or there’s a significant spike in traffic or users.
##### 3. Cloud Hosting
[Cloud hosting](https://www.dreamhost.com/cloud/) services, such as DreamHost’s [DreamObjects](https://www.dreamhost.com/cloud/storage/), Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure, provide virtualized infrastructure and managed services to host and run applications.

Cloud hosting offers flexibility, scalability, and reliability, allowing developers to easily deploy and manage their applications without worrying about underlying hardware and networking.

Resources can be provisioned or released as needed, and costs are typically based on usage.

**Cloud hosting (or cloud computing) is sort of the inverse of VPS. Rather than a single server being divided up into multiple instances, a cloud hosting setup will pull resources from multiple servers to provide the computing power you need to handle your current traffic or users.**
###### Advantages of Cloud Hosting

Cloud hosting is, essentially, infinitely scalable.

In theory, there are no limitations to the resources you can pull for a specific project. This makes it ideal for site or mobile app hosting which might see big swings in traffic and users.

Pricing is also pay-as-you-go based on resources, meaning you only pay for what you use.

###### Disadvantages of Cloud Hosting

The downside of hosting a mobile app with a pay-for-what-you-use model is that if you get way more traffic or users than expected, your bill could also be higher than you expect.

##### 4. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
PaaS providers, such as Heroku or Google App Engine, offer a complete development and hosting environment, including the infrastructure, runtime, and necessary tools.

It’s sort of like leasing a pickup truck, but you can only drive it on certain roads. You don’t have to worry about maintenance or upkeep, but you’re also relying on the company to provide you with everything you need to get up and running with your app. Plus, you’re locked into using the tools and systems offered by the provider.

###### Advantages of PaaS

PaaS makes it super simple to start, build, and deploy a mobile app. With the right provider, you can be up and running in a matter of hours. You won’t need to tinker with servers or install a bunch of applications.

Most PaaS offerings are also pay-as-you-go.

###### Disadvantages of PaaS

Since you’re leasing the pickup truck and can only drive it on certain roads, PaaS has some limitations depending on your chosen provider.

For instance, they may or may not offer support for popular services like Docker or Kubernetes.

Certain software development kits (SDKs) may or may not be available.

Now, if you can find the right provider that aligns with your preferred tool stack, you can use PaaS as a SaaS solution for mobile app development, deployment, and hosting.






##### 5. Mobile Backend-as-a-Service (MBaaS)
MBaaS platforms, like Firebase or Parse (now open-source), are specialized app hosting services specifically designed for mobile applications. They provide pre-built backend components, APIs, and tools to streamline mobile app development and hosting.

Think of services like user authentication or push notifications. MBaaS offers these out of the box.

It’s like a dongle for your laptop connected to a bunch of microservices you can tap into with a few clicks.

This means you have complete control over the front-end, and then you plug in the dongle to connect to back-end services. Bringing it back to the pickup truck metaphor, this would be like leasing a truck, but you can only drive it to certain destinations.

###### Advantages of MBaaS

Like PaaS, MBaaS is popular as a quick and simple solution that gets you up and running without much (or any) fuss.

It’s ideal for folks who aren’t super deep into backend coding and setup, and who don’t want to deal with managing relational databases and wiring up microservices.

It’s kind of like a template for app development.

That doesn’t make it a bad choice for more advanced users, but it can be limiting.

###### Disadvantages of MBaaS

While many of the larger MBaaS providers have a lot of flexibility and tons of extensions or services, you’re still limited to what they offer.

That limits the amount of customization you can do and the amount of control you have over the environment and app performance, and generally relies heavily on the provider to ensure everything goes smoothly.

### How to Implement App Hosting
1. **Choose a hosting provider:** Based on your application’s requirements, scalability needs, cost, and other factors, select the appropriate app hosting provider and type (e.g., traditional hosting, VPS, cloud hosting, PaaS, or MBaaS).
2. **Sign up for an account:** Register for an account with your chosen hosting provider, and select the appropriate plan or resource allocation based on your needs.
3. **Set up the hosting environment:** Depending on the provider and hosting type, you may need to configure the server environment, install an operating system, set up a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx), and install necessary runtime environments and frameworks (e.g., Node.js, Python, Ruby on Rails).
4. **Deploy your application’s server-side components:** Upload your application’s backend code and files to the hosting environment using the provider’s recommended deployment method (e.g., Git, FTP, or provider-specific tools). This includes server-side scripts, database files, and any required dependencies.
5. **Configure the database:** If your application uses a database, create and configure the database instance (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) according to your application’s requirements. You may also need to import your database schema and initial data.
6. **Set up domain and security certificate:** If you have a custom domain for your application, configure the DNS settings to point to your hosting provider’s servers. Additionally, install and configure an [SSL certificate](https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/your-connection-is-not-private/) to enable secure HTTPS connections.
7. **Configure security features and access controls:** Implement and configure security measures such as user authentication, data encryption, and access controls to protect your application and its data.
8. **Test your deployment:** Ensure that your application is running correctly on the hosting environment by testing its functionality and performance. Address any issues or bugs that arise during testing.
9. **Monitor and optimize:** Once your application is live, continuously monitor its performance and resource usage. Identify bottlenecks and optimize your hosting environment as needed (e.g., by adding resources, implementing caching, or using a content delivery network).
10. **Plan for scaling and disaster recovery:** Develop strategies for handling increased demand and ensuring application availability, including redundancy, failover mechanisms, regular backups, and disaster recovery plans.

### Now that the Application is Hosted Next Steps?

###  What is a Hosted Application?

The definition of a hosted application is any software that is installed on a remote server which users can access and use through the internet by means of a recurring subscription service, usually through a third party hosting provider. A remote server infrastructure houses hosted applications and the hosting provider maintains the servers and ensures application uptime and security.
