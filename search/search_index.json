A hypervisor communicates directly with a physical server\u2019s disk space and CPU to manage the VMs. Hardware virtualization, which is also known as server virtualization, allows hardware resources to be utilized more efficiently and for one machine to simultaneously run different operating systems.</p> </li> <li> <p>Software virtualization: Software virtualization creates a computer system complete with hardware that allows one or more guest operating systems to run on a physical host machine. For example, Android OS can run on a host machine that is natively using a Microsoft Windows OS, utilizing the same hardware as the host machine does. Additionally, applications can be virtualized and delivered from a server to an end user\u2019s device, such as a laptop or smartphone. This allows employees to access centrally hosted applications when working remotely.</p> </li> <li> <p>Storage virtualization: Storage can be virtualized by consolidating multiple physical storage devices to appear as a single storage device. Benefits include increased performance and speed, load balancing and reduced costs. Storage virtualization also helps with disaster recovery planning, as virtual storage data can be duplicated and quickly transferred to another location, reducing downtime.</p> </li> <li> <p>Network virtualization: Multiple sub-networks can be created on the same physical network by combining equipment into a single, software-based virtual network resource. Network virtualization also divides available bandwidth into multiple, independent channels, each of which can be assigned to servers and devices in real time. Advantages include increased reliability, network speed, security and better monitoring of data usage. Network virtualization can be a good choice for companies with a high volume of users who need access at all times.</p> </li> <li> <p>Desktop virtualization: This common type of virtualization separates the desktop environment from the physical device and stores a desktop on a remote server, allowing users to access their desktops from anywhere on any device. In addition to easy accessibility, benefits of virtual desktops include better data security, cost savings on software licenses and updates, and ease of management.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Azure/Services/Azure%20virtual%20Machine/#container-vs-virtual-machine","title":"Container vs virtual machine","text":"<p>Like\u202fvirtual machines, container technology such as\u00a0Kubernetes\u00a0is similar in the sense of running isolated applications on a single platform. While virtual machines virtualize the hardware layer to create a \u201ccomputer,\u201d containers package up just a single app along with its dependencies. Virtual machines are often managed by a hypervisor, whereas container systems provide shared operating system services from the underlying host and isolate the applications using virtual-memory hardware.</p> <p>A key benefit of containers is that they have less overhead compared to virtual machines. Containers include only the binaries, libraries and other required dependencies, and the application. Containers that are on the same host share the same operating system kernel, making containers much smaller than virtual machines. As a result, containers boot faster, maximize server resources, and make delivering applications easier. Containers have become popular for use cases such as web applications,\u00a0DevOps\u00a0testing, microservices and maximizing the number of apps that can be deployed per server.</p> <p>Virtual machines are larger and slower to boot than containers. They are logically isolated from one another, with their own operating system kernel, and offer the benefits of a completely separate operating system. Virtual machines are best for running multiple applications together, monolithic applications, isolation between apps, and for legacy apps running on older operating systems.

This setup allows you to apply updates while knowing that only one update domain grouping is offline at a time. All of the machines in one update domain update. An update group going through the update process is given a 30-minute time to recover before maintenance on the next update domain starts.</li> <li>Fault domain: The fault domain groups your VMs by common power source and network switch.

The ability to run certain applications in the public cloud as opposed to creating a traditional infrastructure to run them can provide substantial economic benefits. For example, an application might need to handle fluctuations in demand. Shutting down VMs when you don't need them or quickly starting them up to meet a sudden increase in demand means you pay only for the resources you use.</li> <li>When extending your datacenter to the cloud: An organization can extend the capabilities of its own on-premises network by creating a virtual network in Azure and adding VMs to that virtual network. Applications like SharePoint can then run on an Azure VM instead of running locally. This arrangement makes it easier or less expensive to deploy than in an on-premises environment.</li> <li>During disaster recovery: As with running certain types of applications in the cloud and extending an on-premises network to the cloud, you can get significant cost savings by using an IaaS-based approach to disaster recovery.

The intended receiver will accept the message and all other computers will ignore the message. It is used for N-to-N communication. Here, N indicates all computers of the network.</p> </li> <li> <p>Switch: Switch is networking device as one of computer network components. It looks like hub but it does not work similar to the hub.It has got built-in memory and intelligence. It sends the data to the specific receiver. It uses physical device addresses in each incoming messages so that it can deliver the message to the right destination or port. It is used for point-to-point (P-to-P) communication. Here, P indicates identificationof a specific computer.Both switch and hub have common features: Multiple RJ-45 ports, power supply and connection lights.</p> </li> <li> <p>Router: Routers are mainly used to send the message from source machine to the destination machine. There is a large number of routers are connected among themselves. Hence, there may be several alternative paths from source router to the destination router. Router finds the best possible path between them using routing algorithms and routing table information. Router tables are used to stores information of other neighbour routers in the network. Router also can be used to connect LANs, MANs or WANs.</p> <ul> <li>Routing Algorithms: Routing algorithms are important in the computation of the best routes through which data packets in a network should pass through.

The parameters that are used in adaptive routing algorithms are distance, hop, estimated transit time and count.</p> </li> <li> <p>Non-Adaptive Routing algorithm: The routing decisions are not made based on network traffic and topology. This algorithm is used by static routing. Non-adaptive routing algorithms are simple as compared to Adaptive routing algorithms in terms of complexity.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> Adaptive Routing algorithm Non-Adaptive Routing algorithm An adaptive algorithm involves routers for exchanging and updating router table data. A non-adaptive algorithm involves a network administrator for the manual entry of the routing paths into the router. This algorithm creates a routing table based on network conditions. Whereas this algorithm creates a static table in order to determine when to send packets and which node. This algorithm is used by dynamic routing. Whereas this algorithm is used by static routing. In adaptive routing algorithm, the routing decisions are made based on network traffic and topology. Whereas in a non-adaptive routing algorithm, the routing decisions are not made based on network traffic and topology. Adaptive routing algorithms are more complex as compared to non-adaptive routing algorithms in terms of complexity. While non-adaptive routing algorithms are simple in terms of complexity. In adaptive routing algorithm, the routing decisions are not static tables. While in non-adaptive routing algorithm, the routing decisions are static tables. Adaptive routing algorithm is categorized into distributed, centralized and isolation algorithm. Whereas non-adaptive routing algorithm is categorized into random walks and flooding. Adaptive routing algorithm is more used as compared to non-adaptive. Whereas non-adaptive routing algorithm is comparatively less used. The dynamic protocols are employed to update the routing table and determine the best route between the source and destination computers. The manual setup is performed for establishing an optimal path between the source and destination computers.
