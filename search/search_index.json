A hypervisor communicates directly with a physical server\u2019s disk space and CPU to manage the VMs. Hardware virtualization, which is also known as server virtualization, allows hardware resources to be utilized more efficiently and for one machine to simultaneously run different operating systems.</p> </li> <li> <p>Software virtualization: Software virtualization creates a computer system complete with hardware that allows one or more guest operating systems to run on a physical host machine. For example, Android OS can run on a host machine that is natively using a Microsoft Windows OS, utilizing the same hardware as the host machine does. Additionally, applications can be virtualized and delivered from a server to an end user\u2019s device, such as a laptop or smartphone. This allows employees to access centrally hosted applications when working remotely.</p> </li> <li> <p>Storage virtualization: Storage can be virtualized by consolidating multiple physical storage devices to appear as a single storage device. Benefits include increased performance and speed, load balancing and reduced costs. Storage virtualization also helps with disaster recovery planning, as virtual storage data can be duplicated and quickly transferred to another location, reducing downtime.</p> </li> <li> <p>Network virtualization: Multiple sub-networks can be created on the same physical network by combining equipment into a single, software-based virtual network resource. Network virtualization also divides available bandwidth into multiple, independent channels, each of which can be assigned to servers and devices in real time. Advantages include increased reliability, network speed, security and better monitoring of data usage. Network virtualization can be a good choice for companies with a high volume of users who need access at all times.</p> </li> <li> <p>Desktop virtualization: This common type of virtualization separates the desktop environment from the physical device and stores a desktop on a remote server, allowing users to access their desktops from anywhere on any device. In addition to easy accessibility, benefits of virtual desktops include better data security, cost savings on software licenses and updates, and ease of management.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Services/Azure%20virtual%20Machine/#container-vs-virtual-machine","title":"Container vs virtual machine","text":"<p>Like\u202fvirtual machines, container technology such as\u00a0Kubernetes\u00a0is similar in the sense of running isolated applications on a single platform. While virtual machines virtualize the hardware layer to create a \u201ccomputer,\u201d containers package up just a single app along with its dependencies. Virtual machines are often managed by a hypervisor, whereas container systems provide shared operating system services from the underlying host and isolate the applications using virtual-memory hardware.</p> <p>A key benefit of containers is that they have less overhead compared to virtual machines. Containers include only the binaries, libraries and other required dependencies, and the application. Containers that are on the same host share the same operating system kernel, making containers much smaller than virtual machines. As a result, containers boot faster, maximize server resources, and make delivering applications easier. Containers have become popular for use cases such as web applications,\u00a0DevOps\u00a0testing, microservices and maximizing the number of apps that can be deployed per server.</p> <p>Virtual machines are larger and slower to boot than containers. They are logically isolated from one another, with their own operating system kernel, and offer the benefits of a completely separate operating system. Virtual machines are best for running multiple applications together, monolithic applications, isolation between apps, and for legacy apps running on older operating systems.

This setup allows you to apply updates while knowing that only one update domain grouping is offline at a time. All of the machines in one update domain update. An update group going through the update process is given a 30-minute time to recover before maintenance on the next update domain starts.</li> <li>Fault domain: The fault domain groups your VMs by common power source and network switch. By default, an availability set splits your VMs across up to three fault domains. This helps protect against a physical power or networking failure by having VMs in different fault domains (thus being connected to different power and networking resources).</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Services/Azure%20virtual%20Machine/#examples-of-when-to-use-vms-examples","title":"Examples of when to use VMs #examples","text":"<p>Some common examples or use cases for virtual machines include:</p> <ul> <li>During testing and development.

The ability to run certain applications in the public cloud as opposed to creating a traditional infrastructure to run them can provide substantial economic benefits. For example, an application might need to handle fluctuations in demand. Shutting down VMs when you don't need them or quickly starting them up to meet a sudden increase in demand means you pay only for the resources you use.</li> <li>When extending your datacenter to the cloud: An organization can extend the capabilities of its own on-premises network by creating a virtual network in Azure and adding VMs to that virtual network. Applications like SharePoint can then run on an Azure VM instead of running locally. This arrangement makes it easier or less expensive to deploy than in an on-premises environment.</li> <li>During disaster recovery: As with running certain types of applications in the cloud and extending an on-premises network to the cloud, you can get significant cost savings by using an IaaS-based approach to disaster recovery.
