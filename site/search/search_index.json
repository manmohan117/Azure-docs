Benefits include increased performance and speed, load balancing and reduced costs. Storage virtualization also helps with disaster recovery planning, as virtual storage data can be duplicated and quickly transferred to another location, reducing downtime.</p> </li> <li> <p>Network virtualization: Multiple sub-networks can be created on the same physical network by combining equipment into a single, software-based virtual network resource. Network virtualization also divides available bandwidth into multiple, independent channels, each of which can be assigned to servers and devices in real time.

Availability sets are designed to ensure that VMs stagger updates and have varied power and network connectivity, preventing you from losing all your VMs with a single network or power failure.</p> <p>Availability accomplish these objectives by grouping VMs in two ways: update domain and fault domain.</p> <ul> <li>Update domain: The update domain groups VMs that can be rebooted at the same time. This setup allows you to apply updates while knowing that only one update domain grouping is offline at a time. All of the machines in one update domain update. An update group going through the update process is given a 30-minute time to recover before maintenance on the next update domain starts.</li> <li>Fault domain: The fault domain groups your VMs by common power source and network switch. By default, an availability set splits your VMs across up to three fault domains. This helps protect against a physical power or networking failure by having VMs in different fault domains (thus being connected to different power and networking resources).</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Azure/Services/Azure%20virtual%20Machine/#examples-of-when-to-use-vms-examples","title":"Examples of when to use VMs #examples","text":"<p>Some common examples or use cases for virtual machines include:</p> <ul> <li>During testing and development. VMs provide a quick and easy way to create different OS and application configurations. Test and development personnel can then easily delete the VMs when they no longer need them.</li> <li>When running applications in the cloud. The ability to run certain applications in the public cloud as opposed to creating a traditional infrastructure to run them can provide substantial economic benefits. For example, an application might need to handle fluctuations in demand. Shutting down VMs when you don't need them or quickly starting them up to meet a sudden increase in demand means you pay only for the resources you use.</li> <li>When extending your datacenter to the cloud: An organization can extend the capabilities of its own on-premises network by creating a virtual network in Azure and adding VMs to that virtual network. Applications like SharePoint can then run on an Azure VM instead of running locally. This arrangement makes it easier or less expensive to deploy than in an on-premises environment.</li> <li>During disaster recovery: As with running certain types of applications in the cloud and extending an on-premises network to the cloud, you can get significant cost savings by using an IaaS-based approach to disaster recovery. If a primary datacenter fails, you can create VMs running on Azure to run your critical applications and then shut them down when the primary datacenter becomes operational again.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Azure/Services/Azure%20virtual%20Machine/#move-to-the-cloud-with-vms","title":"Move to the cloud with VMs","text":"<p>VMs are also an excellent choice when you move from a physical server to the cloud (also known as lift and shift).
